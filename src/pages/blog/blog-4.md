#### In online shopping, there are a lot of choices and sometimes there are items you are not able to see, that you might find useful. Here are some of those items that I found.

**_Disclaimer: I am in no way associated with the stores or brands that sell these items._**

1. [**Xiaomi Noise-Cancelling Earphones**](https://www.lazada.com.ph/lucky-hr-xiaomi-mi-noise-cancelling-in-ear-earphone-with-built-in-microphone-35-mm-earphones-headset-modeljzej02jy-i317298052-s653292829.html) - Noise-cancelling earphones for a fraction of price than the big brands like Apple and Sony, if having a cable is not an issue for you. I bought them before at P1,839, this time it is a little bit higher at **P1,989**

2. **Sandisk TYPE-C Ultra Dual 3.1 OTG USB Drive** - This one could be very useful if you need an OTG Flash Drive for your phone with USB Type-C port. It still has a standard USB 3.1 plug to plug it in your computer. You could get it at [P290(16GB)](https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/sandisk-sdddc2-16gb-type-c-ultra-dual-31-otg-usb-drive-i8855191-s11264129.html?spm=a2o4l.store_campaign.promotionWhatYouSee_933552589.1), [P434(32GB)](https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/sandisk-sdddc2-32gb-type-c-ultra-dual-31-otg-usb-drive-i100165592-s100196400.html?mp=3&spm=a2o4l.store_campaign.promotionCountdownProduct_933552591.0), [P609(64GB)](https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/sandisk-sdddc2-64gb-type-c-ultra-dual-31-otg-usb-drive-i207541713-s262852335.html?spm=a2o4l.store_campaign.promotionWhatYouSee_933552589.0)

#### Also here are some of the items on prior sales I've bought that I found you might want to add to your wishlist for future promotions and flash sales.

-   [**Ringke Foldable Laptop Stand**](https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/ringke-folding-stand-portable-and-foldable-laptop-stand-for-desktop-macbook-notebook-computer-ipad-tablet-i282802120-s439298225.html) - I've used this quite a lot before the COVID-19 pandemic at home, at the office, and the local coffee shop. it is a small laptop stand to give some elevation on your machine. What's best about it is you can flatten it like a piece of paper and put it in your bag once you're done using it. And you don't need to stick it at the base of your laptop, unlike similar products.
